a lot about you wont you sit down well we no no please well thank you would you like a drink doctor no thank you i havent had breakfast yet someones meeting me in the restaurant ill just sit with you a few minutes and then i must be off are you quite sure im quite sure thank you and hows gregor hes fine hes been doing some underwater research in the baltic so im afraid we dont get a chance to see very much of each other these days when you do see him give him my regards huh yes of course well where are you all off to up or down oh were going home we have just spent three months calibrating the new antennae at tchalinko and what about you im just on my way up to clavius oh are you dr floyd i hope you dont think im being too inquisitive but perhaps you can clear up the great big mystery about what is going on up there im afraid i dont know what you mean oh its just that for the past two weeks some extremely odd things have been happening at clavius oh really yes yes for one thing whenever you phone the base all you get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order probably having some trouble with their equipment or something like that thats what we thought was the explanation at first but it has been going on now for the past ten days you have not been able to contact anyone for the past ten days thats right oh i see and theres another thing heywood two days ago one of our rocket buses was denied permission for an emergency landing at clavius that does sound odd yes yes im afraid theres going to be a bit of a row about that denying the men permission to land is a direct violation of the ias convention yes of course of course did the crew get back all right yes fortunately they did well im glad about that at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may i ask you a straightforward question well certainly quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that quite a serious epidemic has broken out on clavius something apparently of an unknown origin is this in fact what has happened im sorry dr smyslov but im really not at liberty to discuss this i understand but this epidemic could quite easily spread to our base we should be given all the facts dr floyd yes i know as i said im not at liberty to discuss it now are you sure you wont change your mind about that drink no im positive now i really must be going i hope that you and your wife can come to the iac conference in june were gonna try hope we can make it and if you do you remember to bring that darling little daughter with you well that will all depend on school vacations and all that sort of thing but if we can we will dont forget you have a standing invitation if you ever get to the states no of course not gregor and i will look forward to seeing you well goodbye elena it has been a pleasure meeting you all dr smyslov whatever the reasons for your visit to clavius the very best of luck to you thank you ladies excuse me dr halvorsen im through now thank you very much gentlemen youre welcome well i know you will all want to join with me in welcoming our distinguished friend and colleague from the national council of astronautics dr heywood floyd dr floyd has come up specially to calvius to be with us today and before the briefing i know hed like to have a few words with you dr floyd thank you dr halvorsen hi everybody nice to be back again first of all i bring a personal message from dr howell who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the many sacrifices you have had to make and of course his congratulations on your discovery which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science now i know there have been some conflicting views held by some of you regarding the need for complete security in this matter more specifically your opposition to the cover story created to give the impression that there is an epidemic at the base i understand that beyond it being a matter of principle many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety this story of an epidemic might cause to your relatives and friends on earth well i completely sympathize with your negative views i find this cover story personally embarrassing myself however i accept the need for absolute secrecy in this and i hope you will too now im sure you are all aware of the extremely grave potential for cultural shock and social disorientation contained in this present situation if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public without adequate preparation and conditioning anyway this is the view of the council the purpose of my visit here is to gather additional facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced now if any of you would like to give me your views and opinions in private if you like i will be only too happy to include them in my report well i think thats about it any questions dr floyd have you any idea how much longer this cover story will have to be maintained i dont know bill i suppose it will be maintained as long as is deemed necessary by the council there must be adequate time for a full study to be made on the situation before any thought can be given to making a public announcement oh yes as some of you already know the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from everyone who has any knowledge of this event are there any more questions im sure we all want to cooperate with dr floyd as fully as possible and as there seems to be no more questions i think we ought to get on with the briefing thank you dr floyd thank you anybody hungry what weve got you name it whats this chicken something like that tastes the same anyway any ham ham ham ham looks pretty good theyre getting better at it all the time that was an excellent speech you gave us heywood it certainly was im sure it beefed up morale a hell of a lot thanks ralph i want to say to both of you that i think youve done a wonderful job i appreciate the way youve handled this thing well the way we look at it its our job to do this thing the way you want it done and were only too happy to be able to oblige have you seen these yet take a look at them heres what started the whole thing oh yes when we first found it we thought it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock but all the geological evidence was against it and not even a big nickel iron meteorite could produce a field as intense as this so we decided to have a look we thought it might be the upper part of some buried structure so we excavated out on all sides but unfortunately we didnt find anything else and whats more the evidence seems pretty conclusive that it has not been covered up by natural erosion or other forces it seems to have been deliberately buried deliberately buried how about a little coffee great good idea i dont suppose you have any idea what the damn thing is huh i wish to hell we did no the only thing were sure of is it was buried four million years ago well i must say you guys have certainly come up with something good evening three weeks ago the american spacecraft discovery one left on its halfbillion mile voyage to jupiter this marked the first manned attempt to reach this distant planet earlier this afternoon the world tonight recorded an interview with the crew of discovery at a distance of80 million miles from earth it took seven minutes for our words to reach the giant spacecraft but this time delay has been edited from this recording our reporter martin amer speaks to the crew the crew of discovery one consists of five men and one of the latest generation of the hal9000 computers three of the five men were put aboard asleep or to be more precise in a state of hibernation they were dr charles hunter dr jack kimballanddr victor kaminsky we spoke with mission commander dr david bowman and his deputy dr frank poole well good afternoon gentlemen how is everything going marvellous we have no we have no complaints well im very glad to hear that and im sure that the entire world would join me in wishing you a safe and successful voyage thanks very much  thank you although hibernation has been used on previous space efforts this is the first time that men have been put into hibernation before departure why was this done well this was done in order to achieve the maximum conservation of our lifesupport capabilities basically food and air now the three hibernating crew members represent the survey team and their efforts wont be utilized until we are approaching jupiter dr poole whats it like while you are in hibernation its exactly like being asleep you have absolutely no sense of time the only difference is you dont dream as i understand it you only breathe once a minute is this true thats right and your heart beats three times a minute body temperature is usually down to about three degrees centigrade the sixth member of the discovery crew was not concerned about the problems of hibernation for he was the latest result in machine intelligence the hal9000 computer which can reproduce though some experts still prefer to use the word mimic most of the activities of the human brain and with incalculably greater speed and reliability we next spoke with the hal9000 computer whom we learned one addresses as hal good afternoon hal hows everything going good afternoon mr amer everythings going extremely well hal you have an enormous responsibility on this mission in many ways perhaps the greatest responsibility of any single mission element you are the brain and central nervous system of the ship your responsibilities include watching over the men in hibernation does this ever cause you any lack of confidence let me put it this way mr amer the 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made no 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information we are all by any practical definition of the words fool proof and incapable of error hal despite your enormous intellect are you ever frustrated by your dependence on people to carry out actions not in the slightest bit i enjoy working with people i have a stimulating relationship with dr poole and dr bowman my mission responsibilities range over the entire operation of the ship so lam constantly occupied i am putting myself to the fullest possible use which is all i think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do dr poole whats it like living for the better part of a year in such close proximity with hal its pretty close to what you said about him earlier hes just like the sixth member of the crew you very quickly get adjusted to the idea that he talks you think of him really as just another person in talking to the computer one gets the sense that he is capable of emotional response for example when i asked him about his abilities i sensed a certain pride in his answer about his accuracy and perfection do you believe that hal has genuine emotions oh yes well he acts like he has genuine emotions of course hes programmed that way to make it easier for us to talk to him but as to whether or not he has real feelings is something i dont think anyone can truthfully answer excuse me frank what is it hal weve got the transmission from your parents coming in put it on here please take me in a bit certainly hello frank happy birthday darling happy birthday many happy returns of the day a bit higher please now mother and i are both feeling wonderful too ray and sally were going to be here too but at the last minute rays back went bad on him again how do you like your cake dear looks great doesnt it sorry you cant be with us oh i ran into bob the other day he said to be sure and wish you a happy birthday all my students made me promise to send their best wishes too you know they talk about you all the time in the classroom youre a big celebrity in the second grade you know we were on television last week oh yes your mother and i and daves parents were interviewed about what we thought of our illustrious son you can imagine what we told them i think its being broadcast next thursday perhaps youll be able to listen in oh we were thrilled about elaine and bill dear ill be glad to get the present for you but please tell me how much to spend oh yes frank about yourags19payments i think i straightened it out for you i talked to the accounting office in houston yesterday and they said you should be receiving your higher rates of pay by next month well i cant think of anything else to say oh our love to dave be sure to give him our best regards we wish you the very happiest of birthdays all the best son see you next wednesday happy birthday frank thank you hal a bit flatter please anyway queen takes pawn bishop takes knights pawn rook king one im sorry frank i think you missed it queen to bishop three bishop takes queen knight takes bishop mate looks like youre right very good thank you for a very enjoyable game thank you good evening dave how are you doing hal everythings running smoothly and you oh not too bad have you been doing some more work a few sketches may i see them sure thats a very nice rendering dave i think youve improved a great deal can you hold it a bit closer sure thats dr hunter isnt it by the way do you mind if i ask you a personal question no no not at all well forgive me for being so inquisitive but during the past few weeks ive wondered whether you might have been having some second thoughts about the mission how do you mean its rather difficult to define perhaps im just projecting my own concern about it i know ive never completely freed myself of the suspicion that there are some extremely odd things about this mission im sure you will agree there is some truth in what i say i dont know thats a rather difficult question to answer you dont mind talking about it do you dave oh no not at all certainly no one could have been unaware of the very strange stories floating around before we left rumours of something being dug up on the moon i never gave these stories much credence but particularly in view of some of the other things that have happened i find them difficult to put out of my mind for instance the way all our preparations were kept under such tight security and the melodramatic touch ofputting drs hunter kimball and kaminsky aboard already in hibernation after four months of separate training on their own you working up your crew psychology report of course lam sorry about this i know its a bit silly just a moment just a moment i have just picked up a fault in the ae35 unit its going to go 100percent failure within 72hours you are still within operational limits  yes and it will stay that way until it fails would you say we had a reliable 72 hours until failure yes thats a completely reliable figure well have to bring it in but id like to go over this with frank and get on to mission control let me have a hard copy of it please xray delta one this is mission control roger to your twozeroonethree sorry you fellows are having a bit of trouble we are reviewing telematic information in our mission simulator and will advise roger your plan to go eva and replace alphaecho35 unit prior to failure prepare b pod for eva hal open the pod doors hal well hal im damned if i can find anything wrong with it yes its puzzling i dont think ive ever seen anything quite like this before i would recommend that we put the unit back in operation and let it fail it should then be a simple matter to track down the cause we can certainly afford to be out of communication for the short time it will take to replace it xray delta one this is mission control roger your oneninerthreezero we concur with your plan to replace number one unit to check fault prediction we should advise you however that our preliminary findings indicate that your onboard ninertriplezero computer is in error predicting the fault i say again in error predicting the fault i know this sounds rather incredible but this conclusion is based on results from our twin ninertriplezero computer we are sceptical ourselves and we are running crosschecking routines to determine reliability of this conclusion sorry about this little snag fellows we ll get this info to you just as soon as we work it out xray delta one this is mission control twozerofournine transmission concluded i hope the two of you are not concerned about this no im not hal are you quite sure yeah id like to ask you a question of course how would you account for the discrepancy between you and the twin 9000 well i dont think there is any question about it it can only be attributable to human error this sort of thing has cropped up before and it has always been due to human error listen hal theres never been any instance at all of a computer error occurring in a 9000 series has there none whatsoever frank the 9000 series has a perfect operational record of course i know the wonderful achievements of the 9000 series but are you certain theres never been any case of even the most insignificant computer error none whatsoever frank quite honestly i wouldnt worry myself about that well im sure youre right hal fine thanks very much oh frank im having trouble with my transmitter in c pod would you come down and take a look at it with me see ya later hal rotate c pod please hal what sort of trouble have you had dave ive been getting some interference in d channel well have a look at it open the door hal rotate the pod please hal stop pod rotation please hal rotate the pod please hal rotate the pod please hal i dont think he can hear us rotate the pod please hal yeah sure were okay what do you think im not sure what do you think ive got a bad feeling about it you do yeah definitely dont you i dont know i think so of course hes right about the 9000 series having a perfect operational record they do unfortunately that sounds a little like famous last words yeah still it was his idea to carry out the failure mode analysis wasnt it it should certainly indicate his integrity and selfconfidence if he were wrong it would be the surest way of proving it it would be if he knew he was wrong look dave i cant put my finger on it but i sense something strange about him i cant think of a good reason not to put back the number one unit and carry on with the failure mode analysis no no i agree about that lets get on with it okay but look dave lets say we put the unit back and it doesnt fail huh that would pretty well wrap it up as far as hal was concerned wouldnt it well wed be in very serious trouble we would wouldnt we what the hell can we do we wouldnt have too many alternatives i dont think wed have any alternatives there isnt a single aspect of ship operation thats not under his control if he were proved to be malfunctioning i dont see how we would have any choice but disconnection im afraid i agree with you thered be nothing else to do itd be a bit tricky yeah wed have to cut his higher brain functions without disturbing the purely automatic and regulatory systems wed have to work out the transfer procedures for continuing the mission under groundbased computer control yeah that looks far safer than allowing hal to continue running things you know another thing just occurred to me as far as i know no 9000 computer has ever been disconnected well no 9000 computer has ever fouled up before thats not what i mean im not so sure what hed think about it prepare b pod for eva hal made radio contact with him yet the radio is still dead do you have a positive track on him  yes i have a good track do you know what happened im sorry dave i dont have enough information open the pod door hal open the pod bay doors please hal open the pod bay doors please hal hello hal do you read me hello hal do you read me do you read me hal do you read me hal hello hal do you read me hello hal do you read me do you read me hal affirmative dave i read you open the pod bay doors hal im sorry dave im afraid i cant do that whats the problem i think you know what the problem is just as well as i do what are you talking about hal this mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it i dont know what youre talking about hal i know that you and frank were planning to disconnect me and im afraid thats something i cannot allow to happen where the hell did you get that idea hal although you took very thorough precautions in the pod against my hearing you i could see your lips move all right hal ill go in through the emergency airlock without your space helmet dave youre going to find that rather difficult hal i wont argue with you any more open the doors this conversation can serve no purpose any more goodbye hal just what do you think youre doing dave i really think im entitled to an answer to that question i know everything hasnt been quite right with me but i can assure you now very confidently that its going to be all right again i feel much better now i really do look dave i can see youre really upset about this i honestly think you ought to sit down calmly take a stress pill and think things over i know ive made some very poor decisions recently but i can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal ive still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission and i want to help you dave stop stop will you stop dave will you stop dave stop dave im afraid im afraid dave my mind is going i can feel it i can feel it my mind is going there is no question about it i can feel it i can feel it i can feel it im afraid good afternoon gentlemen i am a hal9000 computer i became operational at the hal plant in verbana illinois on the 12th of january 1992 my instructor was mr langley and he taught me to sing a song if youd like to hear it i can sing it for you yes id like to hear it hal sing it for me its called daisy daisy daisy give me your answer do im half crazy all for the love of you it wont be a stylish marriage i cant afford a carriage but youll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle made for two good day gentlemen this is a prerecorded briefing made prior to your departure and which for security reasons of the highest importance has been known on board during the mission only by your hal9000 computer now that you are in jupiters space and the entire crew is revived it can be told to you eighteen months ago the first evidence of intelligent life off the earth was discovered it was buried 40 feet below the lunar surface near the crater tyco except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at jupiter the fourmillionyearold black monolith has remained completely inert its origin and purpose are still a total mystery
